Bridle-Calculator

THE APPLICATION IS FOR NOW IN FRENCH. I'm translating it and doing the GUI...

This is a Bridle Calculator for rigging.
It calculates :
-the the tension on your steels 
-the bridle angle 
-the horizontal and vertical forces
-the height of your hoist hook.
It's a iBridle like app.
You can calculate it with 2 differrent ways.
  1) let the app do the calculation by entering just the raw distances
  2) by defining the lenght of first steel (the short one) and implying that you have a deckchain on the other end of the bridle.
